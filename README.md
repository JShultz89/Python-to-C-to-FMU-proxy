# Python-to-C-to-FMU-proxy
This is preliminary code for calling python code from a C file so that the C code could be wrapped into an FMU as an FMU proxy. Not currently working but can be used for reference by other researchers. 

Look into folder DynamicInputs for the most developed part of the process.
